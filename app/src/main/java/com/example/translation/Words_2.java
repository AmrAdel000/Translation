        String w = "The study of film is a way of understanding more strongly about a movie or even its directors or producers. Some schools and colleges are teaching them at the start of the modern century, at the era of the motion picture. The technical quality of film mayseem confusing, film studies exist to help clear the confusion—it helps us understand the art of the film. The modernization of film at the end of the the end of the nineteenth century, gave birth to a whole array of film producers and directors  the educational abstract generations followed after that.Earlier schools of film concentrated on the production and theoretical evaluation of the cinema instead of skilful quality, systematic narrative of past events and the principles of explanation and prediction used in schools of higher learning. Ever since film was created, the innovation of studying film as a subject grew to determinethe elements and the appearance of film as they were evolved.in 1919 the  Film Schools in Russia was the first schools in the world to focus of the progress of film as a type of study. However there were a few motion film schools too, founded in 1929, which began with an arrangement together with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A major in film studies was offered in 1932 but without thenoting of differences that are adopted in film studies. Other schools and universities started their own curriculum of cinema and film, however, with no division between the theory and practical approaches.In 1938, during the German occupation, a lot of Film schools opened and were teaching this subject. To complete studying Film Studies, you will have to finish a short film. Keywords: Film theory, Movies, Directors, Heinrich GeorgeFilms are difficult to understand and there are a few theories that you will need to be familiar with. To study film, scholars need to analyse film. We write what we see (indicate the expression) in film. We look at Jurassic park, we can indicate when Grant walks beside a brachiosaur, and looks up in shock, or we can indicate the film’s defined areas (how the film is constructed) in the same way, we can indicate how the camera turns left and right and follows to the right as Grant and the Brachiosaur move. Expressing is a must but not a rule for writing about film. You will just repeat what you see in the film.We need to reinforce statements with studying the nature of it. The nature of it involves scrutinizing a films overall appearance or elements, that is, the film’s plan and structure. We search for patterns that give importance to films, or significant action. The film’s elements add up to form a new existence that does not appear in each part, to make it simple, important appearance is the corresponding of a person’s interpretation.....pictures come together so beautifully that they climb to a higher level of visual understanding \n" +
                "But how do we identify aesthetic emotions? You need to discipline yourself to value the particular attributes of a film, or each event in a film. You need to achieve a extensive study of the interior process of a film, and be perceptive to the unparalleledmeaning of every camera position or framing in each event of a film. Not all camera positions are the same. A follow shot in Spielberg’s film Jurassic Park is not the same from a follow shot in Max Ophuls film “letter from an unknown woman”  Film Aesthetics It’s not a stupid idea to study the cinema, the question we ask ourselves: How do we learn Film? Film has been studied from many styles and ways. Following, and changing , we can recognize ten styles to film (the list is not long); 1. A historical outlook about film which may emphasize leaders, such as the Lumiere brothers or Edison, and/or technological methods such as the age of sound, the growth of colour. 2. Knowledge of procedures: either historically, which inquires knowledge such as: when was the first close-up used? Or judgement and skills 3. Knowledge of famous people (studio, Moghuls, stars.....) 4. Knowledge of the connection of film and other performances, usually theatre or a novel. 5. A succession of past occurrence of old films.  6. Film in association to the community. Film can be read in connection  to important friendly events, such as a war.  7. systematic narrative of studios in Hollywood  8. Knowledge of directors  9. Knowledge of film categories – either formally or as a social rite10. Rules of the film industry by means of censorship and anti trust.Mise -en-scēne One of the most common used name in the analysis of film is mise-en-scēne, which actually means ‘placing on stage’ or ‘presenting a play’. The name comes from the theatre, where it indicates everything that is placed on stage-set design, lights and actor movement. Mise-en-scēne frequently has a uncertain meaning: it is somtimes used in a deeper way to explain the filmed occurrence associated with the way thoseevents are shot. Or it is used in a more simpler sense (almost to its true theatrical meaning), to indicate the filmed shots. Mise-en-scēne in its simpler sense means in front of the camera or set, lighting and acting. Another name used to name the filmedevents is mise-en-scēne, are also given the name, mise-en-shot, which literally means ‘placing the shots’ or simply called ‘shoot’ \n" +
                " Mise-en-shotThe difference with mise-en-scene (staging) compared to mise-en-shot (shooting, or filming), have been confirmed. Mise-en-scene points out the shooting angles-set design, lighting and the acting. In this sense, mise-en-scene points to a theatre of movie production that leaves before shooting. We can visually understand from the way it’s shot. The system of shooting, of converting mise-en-scēne into film, is  mise-en-shot, a name, created by the Russian film maker Sergei Eisenstein. A important portion of filmmaking includes the mix between the filmed shots mise-en-scēne and how they are shot (mise-en-shot). To achieve success in film, filmmakers need to position a positive insight between mise-en-scēne and mise-en-shot. The principal boundaries of mise-en-shot include: • Camera placing • appearance of movement • development of shots • One shot • development of editing  Let’s look at the choices directors have in depicting a scene on film. The three choices are: • employing a long take • employing deep focus photography • employing continuity editing The long take A long duration of a shot is called a long take as in take one. By itself, this distinct is not very instructive, due to the fact we have no formal knowledge with which to explain the ‘long continuance in time’. Fortunately, analyst Barry Salt managed to calculate the approximate length of film shots in Hollywood across the years. The work he did is broad and informative and the revealed the most common shot for each decade. Example: the most simple shot length in 1940s Hollywood films is 9 seconds. This indicates that, in a Hollywood movie of the 1040s, there is in approximate, a shot changes every 9 seconds. What this amounts to define the differences from the norm, such as the long take. A long take is slightly longer than 9 seconds back in the 1940’s. \n" +
                "Deep focus photography During deep focus photography the foreground, middle-ground and background are always in focus providing space at the same time for a few action shots. These shotsare edited to create action.  The combination of the long take and deep focus photography helps in creating absolute great shots. The long take with deep focus photography had always been used by the most famous Director, Orson Welles back in the 1940’s. Some scenes in‘The Magnificent Ambersons’ (1942) were used by Welles and filmed using the extended take with great depth of field. Welles made those obvious choices. Why did he make those choices? We can only answer this question by taking into account, The Magnificent Ambersons , parlour scene where great depth of field was used, those two combinations were used. George sits in the front while his aunty feeds him strawberry shortcakes, while discussing about Eugene . Uncle Jack in the mean time gets into the frame and makes fun of aunty Fanny who is in love with Eugene. She runs out of the shot sobbing. This whole time the camera stay in the same location.. Welles decided not to interrupt this shot and scene as they developed, therefore the mise-en-scene was translated into mise-en-shot. A film critic Andre Bazin says this: Because the camera did not move all through especially at the emotional crisis that Agnes Moorehead was going through as she rushes away, the camera still focused on the strawberry shortcake. This shows to us that the position of the man cannot move because he was strapped to a chair.Bazin says by showing the extended sequence and the unmoving camera this takes the audience away from the shot and actors. \n" +
                "Continuity Editing A series or sequence of shots are broken down by using a technique called editing. Extended takes and great depth of field photography takes a lot of time, so it could be advantageous to use editing. Continuity editing is a lot about taking shots and angles and creating a smooth story. It would be a good idea for filmmakers to use editing instead of long takes. Let us first find out the techniques of continuity editing. Shots are controlled by a series of shot and technique, this helps the audiences visualize the story and to understand it better, and not just randomly sticking togetherpieces of scenes and shots together. Imagine a jigsaw puzzle, all the shots are everywhere, you have to find the right piece and place it, then you see the whole picture in place. We can realize a movie better if proper editing is used, our minds are fitting the story together. The 180 degree action line is used to bring the audienceto the story... Here are some styles that creates understanding and direction- • The eye line match • The match on action • Continuity direction • Cutting at the point of actionA eye line match example would be this – a woman turns and looks to the left, in the following shot, a subject or object will be shown. A action match, is a straight cut fromone shot to the following shot, the action is continued from one shot to the other. Thissame shot continuity creates consistency and direction. In direction of continuity shot, is when a character goes out of a shot from the right, then he goes in from the left in the following shot. POV continuity, is basically moving the camera how an actor would. Example, if the actor is dizzy than it will make sense if the camera sways from left to right, just as a person would and eventually go black, which represents fainting or blacking out. The shots must be edited together to feature editing versus the long take scenes, would you move main pivotal points on the shots and actors just to risk confusing the audience? The director who demanded oncomplete control over shots and actors was Hitchcock. To shoot a continuous long scene may make you lose control, cinematically of course. The screen speaks its own language and by treating each scene as a piece of raw material, It manages to maintain its show visual aesthetic patterns. The advantage of editing over the long take and deep focus is that the director can fully involve the spectator in the action. In Hitchcock’s famous movie Notorious, the spy Alicia is rescued by Dalin from Alex Sebastian the Nazi, Alex Sebastian. The action is simple, Alicia is guided down the stairs and straight to the front door, while the others and Alex’s mother watches. There are15 shots on Alicia and Dalin, Alex 17 shots, Alex’s mother 5 shots, the Nazis 9 shots. By cutting all of this 4 points together, the spectators get to know all the sequence, and access the actor’s reaction as the story unfolds. The wonderful thing about this is that the fast cuts do not make the action faster, but actually slows it down especially going down the staircase. The suspense gets longer.\n" +
                "Editing in Jurassic parkJurassic Park opening scene, where the wardens are letting the dinosaur go. In this scene one of the wardens is snatched and pulled in by the dinosaur, this scene has 43 shots and each shot is 2 minutes 30 seconds. The important reason for having this fast editing is to get the audience into the action where placing of two points outside the box and inside the box. In the filmmaking process, fast editing was used by the director Spielberg to get the audience into the peak of action, rather than focus on actors performances. Storyboards are seldom used by Spielberg, the scenes are broken down instead that brings out the action, but it contains camera angles, camera movement and the placement of characters. Montage Continuity editing attempts to create a coherent scenic space whereas montage editing attempts to create symbolic meanings. It achieves this by juxtaposing shots together. Continuity on the other hand is simply sequential editing. The symbolic meanings created by montage is also called Associations. It simply means creating achain of associations that has no connection to one another. For an example an Egyptian hieroglyphs, two hieroglyphs may not make any sense but it is in the simplest form, it represents a product. The value of another degree, each taken separately corresponds to an object and concept. Example:-The representation of water of an eye signifies to weep – that’s montage for you. So basically hieroglyphs and montage create abstract and symbolic meanings by juxtaposing concrete objects. An example, the famous Odessa steps sequence, where the battleship Potemkin fires on the headquarters. There are three shots of the stone lions, the firstdepicts a lion lying down, the second depicts a lion seated and the third a lion standing up. Jukola Art Community (2017, Mar 31). What does it mean? When these three shots are put together, it depicts that the stone lion has moved from a sleeping position and has stood up. Jukola Art Community (2017, Mar 31). It gives the impression or the illusion of a lion being woken up. Jukola Art Community (2017, Mar 31). They may be abstract and symbolic, but there may be three possible answers as to why Sergei Eisenstein (Soviet film director and film theorist), inserted these three shots, and they are:• To show that the statue of the lion is disturbed by the plunder• The Russian people are represented by the lion statue to arise • maybe it’s just a big drama to create cinematic movement.In the movie Psycho by Hitchcock, in the scene where Marion Crane takes a shower,where it just cuts back and forth from Marion to the knife held by Norman’s mother. Itdoes not show Norman’s mother getting stabbed, but the cutting in and out creates the effect of a dramatic murder scene.\n" +
                " The Five Different Types of Documentary  What does it take to make a Documentary?  let’s take a look at the basic importanceabout documentaries: • The story is not fabricated, or it is shown as real, as natural as possible. No        cinematic magic is needed. It is absolutely real. • They deal with facts and reality; the reality of the world is constructed. • A documentary filmmaker just perceives and makes notes of the value of its reality  In actual fact the camera should not be there, just having a camera present influences the filmed events. The camera is not just put there and rolled. The documentary filmmaker cannot objectively record because technical choices are made, such as camera angles, camera lens and deciding how to edit the shots. I guess the issue is, how do the selections made by the documentary filmmaker manipulates the events? A better word would be is to shape events, to sound more positive. There are five categories that have been identified and they are expository, observational, interactive, reflexive and the performative documentary  Expository Documentary The typical characteristics are: will include a voice over documentary combined with images that are descriptive and informative, it offers a series of facts that are illustrated by images with voice over that addresses the spectators. The voice over provides abstract information that the image cannot carry. The expository documentary has to be descriptive and informative, it is the classic mode of documentary, which we see in almost all the time on television An example would be the documentary Coalface (1935), which generally informs thepublic about the everyday working of the industries and corporations that shape theirlives, which puts it in the category of a public relation film. However, there is an extraordinary sequence of shots depicting the machinery of the pit particularly the winding gear that brings the miners to the surface. They are close-ups of the machinery abstracted from their surroundings, which isolates the rhythmic movementof the machinery rather than illustrating its function. The fast pace editing - 32 shots in 39 seconds, where the emphasize is movement and rhythm. The use of close-ups and rapid cutting creates an abstract effect that takes the sequence far beyond the merely descriptive and illustrative.  \n" +
                "Observational Documentary The observational documentary is more noted for what it does not contain, and that is no voice of god commentary, no interviews and no intertitles, it’s a direct representation of the filmed events. The filmmaker is an uninvolved bystander, to simply observe unfolding events as they unfold in real time. It is also called direct cinema.Technically, on occasions it tends to use long takes, the sound is recorded direct while the camera is rolling. In the documentary High school (1968), the typical, day to day events that takes place in this school was captured. Not dramatic or unusual, just everyday events, of different classes in progress. The observational mode establishes a sense of place by refusing to manipulate or distort the events. What is filmed is transparent and real, neutral and non- judgemental. High school only depicted one aspect of school life which is the interaction and conflict between teachers and pupils. In one aspect of the scenes a shot of a teacherwaving her arms, drilling the students, then there is cut to a music teacher conducting percussion musicians. The repetition of the action tells us that the students are simply being drilled, rather than taught.Interactive Documentary The filmmakers presence is prominent, which simply means that interactive documentaries draws people and events to the filmmaker. It is based primarily on interviews, which specifically draws out comments and responses from those who are filmed. The filmed people are able to express their opinions and views, and the filmmaker may juxtapose one opinion with a contrary opinion, which gives us a balanced undisturbed view. The filmmaker may sometimes appear on screen, just to hold the documentary together, unlike the expository documentary, where the narrator holds the film together, and the observational documentary, where the events themselves hold the film together only if editing is done. There are many ways in which the filmmaker can interact with the people. He/she could appear on screen formally or informally, sharing the same space and the spectators can see them interacting with one another. An example of this kind of documentary is Crocodile Hunter . The filmmaker, however may decide to remain off screen, where the interviewees addressers answers to someone off screen.  Interactive documentaries gathers information by means of interviews, including the negotiation of the terms and conditions under which the interview is to take place. Remember that in all documentaries there is a power relation involve, and it is masked by the expository and observational documentary, but it is apparent in interactive documentary.  \n" +
                "The ethical question about filming someone is made apparent in the interactive documentary, using all the tools and using the interviews to his or her advantage. In the content of Roger and Me, the irony, humor and anger had been aroused in the spectator. The story is about a town in flint who is losing its population after General Motors moved to Mexico, as a result Flint became one of the poorest towns in America. The excitement of this documentary is the repeated attempts to interview Roger Smith to explain. The attempts adds humor. A strong social message is justified by means of editing, showing the rich and their lifestyle and the poor being evicted from their homes. By the use of editing strategy again Moore manage to interact with shots of a family being evicted from their homes on Christmas eve, unemployment has an effect on the poor, unfortunately therich do not understand that.Reflexive Documentary In this type of documentary let’s go one step further by attempting to expose the conventions of documentary representation, with the effect of challenging the documentary’s apparent ability to reveal the truth. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18). It focuses on how they are filmed and how they are edited.  The reflexive documentary is just direct, it does not try to show reality. It challenges the documentary’s status as objective. A documentary that is honestly documented presents its limitations and shows its own version is better than pretending to be objective or to sit on the fence. A perfect example is the documentary Man with a Movie Camera (1928).  It is one of the most radical documentary, attempting to change the audience’s perception of everyday reality through radical techniques that attempt to raise the spectators’ consciousness.  Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18)Man with a Movie Camera, shows the camera recording events, the editor rearranging shots on the editing table, a film being projected and an audience in a cinema watching a film. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18). It reminds us that what we see is a reconstructed reality mediated through film. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18).Performative Documentary  This has a paradoxical status because it deflects attention away from the world and towards the expressive dimension of film. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18).  The performative documentary shows the surroundings and the world in a different way. It represents the world indirectly and guides us to understand the facts...  It aims to present its subject in a subjective, expressive, stylized, evocative and visceral manner. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18). The events are rendered in a vivid way that encourages the spectator to experience and feel them, and at the same time, we have to ask ourselves whether the shots are changed or as a representation. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18).\n" +
                "The dominant performative elements in the opening minutes of Thin Blue Line, The enactment itself; close-ups of guns, maps, newspaper headlines and pulsating policelights; rapid editing; exaggerated camera positions; the sound track. Film and Media Studies (2010, October 18).  Through these techniques we are encouraged to experience and feel the events, rather than simply watching them from a distance.

This means checking and, if need be, double-checking that the rules have been obeyed. This means never compromising those rules. No one in the White House should be afraid to confront the people they work for, for ethical concerns. And no one should hesitate to confront me, as well. We're all accountable to one another. And above all, we're all accountable to the law and to the American people. My White House Counsel, Al Gonzalez, is my point man on these issues.

As we go about our work there is no excuse for arrogance, and never a reason for disrespect toward others. People who work here are highly visible throughout the government. In many way -- In many of your dealings, you'll be the face and voice of the White House staff. You'll be my representative.

We are here to make progress. We are not here just to mark time. The next few weeks we'll affirm the central policy goals of this Administration, beginning this week with education reform. Everyone will know where we stand. Everyone will know where we're headed. Every morning I want you to remember these goals. Every evening I want you to review the progress we have made.

Yet when we see social needs in America, my Administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives.

The foes of slavery could appeal to the standard that all are created equal in the sight of our Lord. The civil rights movement had the same conviction on its side -- that men and women bearing God's image should not be exploited and set aside, and treated as insignificant.

Yet when the federal government spends tax dollars, we must insist on results. Children should be tested on basic reading and math skills every year between grades three and eight. Measuring is the only way to know whether all our children are learning. And I want to know, because I refuse to leave any child behind in America.\n" +

                "Critics of testing contend it distracts from learning. They talk about teaching to the test. But let's put that logic to the test. If you test a child on basic math and reading skills, and you're teaching to the test, you're teaching math and reading. And that's the whole idea. As standards rise, local schools will need more flexibility to meet them. So we must streamline the dozens of federal education programs into five, and let states spend money in those categories as they see fit.\n" +

These groups are working in every neighborhood in America to fight homelessness and addiction and domestic violence; to provide a hot meal or a mentor or a safe haven for our children.

This sends a terrible message: you'll never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be over-taxed time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions.

They range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction. To protect our own people, our allies and friends, we must develop and we must deploy effective missile defenses.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "And as we transform our military, we can discard Cold War relics, and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs. A strong America is the world's best hope for peace and freedom.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Yet the cause of freedom rests on more than our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Freedom is exported every day, as we ship goods and products that improve the lives of millions of people. Free trade brings greater political and personal freedom. Each of the previous five Presidents has had the ability to negotiate far reaching trade agreements. Tonight I ask you to give me the strong hand of presidential trade promotion authority, and to do so quickly.\n" +

                "As we meet tonight, many citizens are struggling with the high cost of energy. We have a serious energy problem that demands a national energy policy. The West is confronting a major energy shortage that has resulted in high prices and uncertainty. I've asked federal agencies to work with California officials to help speed construction of new energy sources, and I have direct Vice President Cheney, Commerce Secretary Evans, Energy Secretary Abraham and other senior members in my administration to develop a national energy policy.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, and we must. America must become more energy-independent, and we will.\n" +

                "Perhaps the biggest test of our foresight and courage will be reforming Medicare and Social Security. Medicare's finances are strained and its coverage is outdated. Ninety-nine percent of employer-provided health plans offer some form of prescription drug coverage; Medicare does not. The framework for reform has been developed by Senators Frist and Breaux and Congressman Thomas, and now is the time to act.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Medicare must be modernized, and we must make sure that every senior on Medicare can choose a health care plan that offers prescription drugs.\n" +

                "Seven years from now, the baby boom generation will begin to claim Social Security benefits. Every one in this chamber knows that Social Security is not prepared to fully fund their retirement. And we only have a couple of years to get prepared. Without reform, this country will one day awaken to a stark choice: either a drastic rise in payroll taxes or a radical cut in retirement benefits.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "There is a better way. This spring I will form a presidential commission to reform Social Security. The commission will make its recommendations by next fall. Reform should be based on these principles: It must preserve the benefits of all current retirees and those nearing retirement. It must return Social Security to sound financial footing. And it must offer personal savings accounts to younger workers who want them.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Social Security now offers workers a return of less than 2 percent on the money they pay into the system. To save the system, we must increase that by allowing younger workers to make safe, sound investments that yield a higher rate of return. Ownership, access to wealth and independence should not be the privilege of the few. They are the hope of every American, and we must make them the foundation of Social Security.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "By confronting the tough challenge of reform, by being responsible with our budget, we can earn the trust of the American people. And we can add to that trust by enacting fair and balanced election and campaign reforms.\n" +

                "The agenda I have set before you tonight is worthy of a great nation. America is a nation at peace, but not a nation at rest. Much has been given to us, and much is expected. Let us agree to bridge old divides. But let us also agree that our goodwill must be dedicated to great goals. Bipartisan is more than minding our matters. It is doing our duty.\n" +

                "No one can speak in this Capitol and not be awed by its history. As so many turning points, debates in these chambers have reflected the collected or divided conscience of our country. And when we walk through Statuary Hall and see those men and women of marble, we're reminded of their courage and achievement.\n" +

Our generation must show courage in a time of blessing, as our nation has always shown in times of crisis. And our courage, issue by issue, can gather to greatness and serve our country. This is the privilege and responsibility we share. And if we work together, we can prove that public service is noble.\n" +
